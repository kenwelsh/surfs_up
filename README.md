## Summary

We have done a preliminary analysis of seasonal differences on Oahu by looking at the historical temperatures for June and December for the years 2010 through Aug 2017.  Key findings:

+ While there is a noticeable difference in temperatures between June and December in Oahu, the variance is not as extreme as you will find in places like the Northeast of the US.  The two months are relatively similar, with only a four-degree difference in average temperature (June 75 F and December 71 F â€“ see table below).
+ There is only a two-degree difference between the maximum temperature, with June at 85 and December at 83, but an eight-degree difference in the minimum temperature with June at 64 and December at 56.  December exhibits a broader range of temperatures with 27 degrees between max and min compared to 21 for June.
+ Looking at a frequency distribution, June is more likely to have days over 75 degrees than December, and December is more likely to have days where temperatures dip below 70 degrees (see charts below).  


On average, the two months are similar in temperature, with December being noticeably cooler.  The cooler temperature in December may lead to lighter customer traffic for surfing and ice cream but is not significant enough to suggest a drastic dropoff.  We expect that some locals and tourists from warmer climates may be less likely to surf in December. Still, the diehard surfers and tourists from colder climates will find the temperature range suitable for these activities.  Our belief is we will see a seasonal slowdown, but not a full stop in service.


Additional analysis to consider:
+ Extending the current study on temperature trends for June and December to include precipitation trends may give further insights on potential seasonal impacts.  A combination of higher or more frequent rainfall, in conjunction with lower temperatures, may have a more severe effect on customer traffic.
+ The statistical weather data should be pulled and summarized for all months and charted to show the seasonal cycle.  This data can help inform sales and marketing strategies to help offset seasonal slowdowns.
+ Further extending the analysis down to the station level will help prioritize a geographic expansion plan as we look to open additional sites across Oahu.
